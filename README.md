# ListMyGrocery

This application allows the user to search the Spoonacular API for recipes based on several parameters like keyword, 
diet and restriction, as well as by ingredient.

Then the user may select several or all ingredients per recipe to be added to a master list. 

The user may also save their own recipes and add saved recipe ingredients to their master list. 

# Future Development

The user will be able to recieve their master list via SMS or export it to Wunderlist. 

The user can send their list to a service like Instacart for delivery. 

Master list will be sorted by grocery section.
